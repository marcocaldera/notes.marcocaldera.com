Education is one of the fields that has remained almost untouched in the last few economic cycles, despite the rising cost of education and the ever-evolving world. Many jobs have become more productive and efficient with time due to new technologies, but not so much for education.

However, by reimagining education in the metaverse, this can change. With the help of 3D technologies and AR/VR headsets, students will be able to experience history firsthand, study art by being in the actual places (i.e., "outdoor" activities will become the norm), experiment with science without buying expensive equipment while having the same experience, build things without physical materials, and more.

All of these experiences will have no marginal costs and will be built in the virtual world once and used by millions of students, lowering the cost of education while making everyone smarter. For example, it is important to remember that the more senses we use while studying, the faster we memorize things in our minds. Touch (with haptic feedback) and sight (with greater vision) are just two of the senses that will be greatly impacted by the metaverse, making it easier to memorize things and making the new generation smarter.
