_Reflection on backward law..._

It seems to me that we should be careful in choosing the values that we uphold every day. If we don't, we risk falling into one of life's many counterintuitive traps: the pursuit and craving for something can actually decrease our chances of achieving it.

Alan Watts once said that the more you try to constantly feel better, the less satisfied you become, as the pursuit of something only reinforces the fact that you feel lacking it in the first place.

Instead of fighting difficult thoughts, let them go or they will keep coming back.

For instance, if I really want to give a good speech in front of an audience, the worst thing I can do is keep focusing on how scared I am and trying to avoid that thought.

But, how can I do that?

One way is to stop fixating on poor values (e.g., wanting to appear confident and capable) and try focusing on better values, such as speak with honesty an curiosity, sharing passion and hope to help people grasping a new topic.

Focus on **giving** something thanks to the speech and not taking something from that.
