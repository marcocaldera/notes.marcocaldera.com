While reading Marcus Aurelius "Meditations," I have been reflecting a lot, and today I had a realization upon seeing this quote:

> "Choose not to be harmed, and you won't feel harmed. Don't feel harmed, and you haven't been."
>
> Marcus Aurelius

I understood quite clearly that whatever we feel is based on our thoughts and not on the actual situation underlying them.
If a situation is causing me suffering, it is not because of the situation itself, but because of the thoughts that I am having about it.

There have likely been many situations where we didn't suffer not because nothing was wrong, but because we simply didn't care.

This realization can be a powerful tool to help us diminish certain negative thoughts that are causing harm.

It is important to remember that this does not mean we should avoid emotions and feelings altogether. Rather, we should use this knowledge to help us gain perspective and to recognize that what is really causing us suffering is **often** our thoughts about a situation, rather than the situation itself.

...and even if sometimes it is a real situation that is letting us hurt and we feel unable to detach, it is ok. With time and reflection, now that we have this tool, we will reach a point in which what is truly hurting us is no longer the situation, but rather our thoughts and perceptions of it.
