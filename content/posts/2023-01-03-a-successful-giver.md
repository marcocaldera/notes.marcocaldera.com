_Reflection of successful givers..._

In his book "Give and Take: Why Helping Others Drives Our Success," Adam Grant identifies three types of people: **takers** (selfish), **matchers** (do ut des), and **givers** (selfless or otherish).

Interestingly, while takers and matchers are typically found in the middle of the pyramid of success, givers can be found at both the bottom and the top.

This is really interesting because it add a lot of variability to just being a giver.

One important factor that contributes to the success of givers is the combination of **self-interest** and **concern for others' interests**, which Grant calls being "otherish."

Successful givers are willing to give more than they receive, but they also consider their own interests when deciding whom, where, and how to give. This is different from unsuccessful givers, who are selflessly sacrificing themselves for others, and from matchers, who expect something in return for every act of giving.
