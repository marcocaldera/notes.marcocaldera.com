Meditate on your mortality. This is one concept about Stoicism that I really like.

This practice involves reflecting on the fact that we are all mortal and will eventually die. While this may seem depressing, it can actually be a powerful tool for gaining perspective and living a more meaningful life.

By contemplating our mortality, we can become more aware of the transient nature of life and the importance of making the most of the time we have. This can help us focus on what truly matters in life and let go of the things that don't. It can also help us cultivate a sense of gratitude for the present moment and the people in our lives.
