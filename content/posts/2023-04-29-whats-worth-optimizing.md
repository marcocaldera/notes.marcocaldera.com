I always aim to make the best decisions, whether it's buying something, developing something, planning something, etc. I strive to make my choices as worthwhile as possible.

However, lately, I have started to wonder if this is the right approach. Since we don't have all the answers and how the future unfold is almost always unpredictable it's incredibly challenging to always make the perfect decision.

The imperfect nature of our decisions means that always striving to make the best one can leave us feeling unhappy. This thought led me to research and finding an interesting concept of **maximizing** versus **satisficing**.

Maximizing is the tendency to select the best option, whereas satisficing is the willingness to settle for a sufficient or "fairly good" one.

Although maximizers are capable of objectively making better decisions, satisficers feel subjectively better. Maximizers are unable to experience happiness to the same degree as satisficers. Furthermore, the tendency to always find the best option can be maladaptive and contribute to a lower experience of happiness, subjective well-being, and a higher incidence of depressive symptoms. Maximizers are often portrayed as unhappy and exhausted from the constant search for the best option[^1].

In conclusion, it seams essential to make a decision once we have evaluated different options through reasoning.
Most decisions can be changed, and only a very small proportion of them cannot be reversed and may have really negative consequences. We should not let the fear of making the wrong one paralyze us. Instead, we should make the "best good enough" decision we can with the information we have and if there is still space for optimising it we can always shrug ours shoulders ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, move on and learn whichever lesson it has for us.
