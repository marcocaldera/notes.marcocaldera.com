# Bitmap storage on Ethereum

## Bitmap storage
{/* excerpt-start */}
Every smart contract on the Ethereum network consume gas to be up and running. Every operation has a fixed gas price that has to be paid in ETH and it turns out.. storing data is one of the most expensive operation.
{/* excerpt-end */}
For this reason when we create a smart contract we should think of being in a machine that has to run operations in the most efficient way possible. From a storage prospective we can think of **bitmaps**.

## Over engineering a grocery list

Let's try bitmapping my weekly groceries list.

This is what I want buy:

- 2 package of rice
- 4 package of egg white
- 5 package of salmon
- 10 tomatoes

Let's create a uint variable[^1]:

```solidity
uint groceries = 0;
```

We initialised groceries as 0 which in binary means:

```
[...240bit...].0000.0000.0000.0000
```

Let's fix a maximum number of items per product that I'll ever buy in a week, 20 (e.g., max 20 tomatoes).

To represent the number 20 we need 5 bits[^2] which means that I can start seeing my `uint groceries` as something like this:

```
[...236bit...].00000.00000.00000.00000
```

The first 5 bits are for the rice, the following 5 for the egg white, etc...

```
	        üçÖ     üç£    üç≥    üçö
[...236bit...].00000.00000.00000.00000
```

### Bitwise OR |

Which type of operation we need to put the _2 package of rice_ inside the first 5 bits of our uint number? This one:

```solidity
groceries |= 2 << 5 * 0;
```

The right side of the operation is simply 2 (the shift is not used because 5\*0=0 and I'll explain it later). The or | works like this:

```
	        üçÖ     üç£    üç≥    üçö
[...236bit...].00000.00000.00000.00000 groceries
[...236bit...].00000.00000.00000.00010 number 2

-------------------------------------- OR operator

[...236bit...].00000.00000.00000.00010 groceries

```

in other term the | operator is useful to write something in a variable.

### Bitwise SHIFT `<<`

To understand the SHIFT operator we can try to add the egg white (4) to the list (the second element, index=1):

```solidity
groceries |= 4 << 5 * 1;
```

The shift operator result in shifting (in binary) the number 4 by 5 bit (i.e., adding 5 leading 0):

```
[...236bit...].00000.00000.00000.00100 number 4
[...236bit...].00000.00000.00100.00000 number 4 << 5
```

which means that the logical or will now do:

```
	        üçÖ     üç£    üç≥    üçö
[...236bit...].00000.00000.00000.00010 groceries
[...236bit...].00000.00000.00100.00000 4 << 5

-------------------------------------- OR operator

[...236bit...].00000.00000.00100.00010 groceries

```

Yay! üéâ We saved our egg white without losing the information on the rice!

### Finalise

By repeating the operation for salmon and tomatoes we obtain the decimal number 332930 which in binary is:

```
[...236bit...].01010.00101.00100.00010 binary
                10üçÖ  5üç£    4üç≥   2üçö  decimal
```

### Full solidity snippet

```solidity
uint groceries = 0;
uint[4] memory shoppingList = [uint(2), 4, 5, 10];
uint index = 0;

do {
	groceries |= shoppingList[index] << 5 * index;
	index++;
} while (shoppingList.length > index);
```

Full code of the contract: [github eth-smart-contract-groceries](https://github.com/marcocaldera/eth-smart-contract-groceries)

[^1]: `uint` is the alias for uint256 and it's a non-negative integer up to 2^256-1
[^2]: The highest number that we can represent with 5 bits is 2^5-1 = 31 -> 11111. With 4 bits we can reach the number 2^4-1 = 15 which is below 20.
