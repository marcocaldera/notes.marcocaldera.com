# The AI Productivity Paradox

{/* excerpt-start */}
Is it all about computation? As I integrate more AI tools into my daily development workflow, both professionally and personally, I'm noticing a fascinating shift in how I approach software development. The implications of this shift raise in me important questions about productivity, competitive advantage, and society impact.

## The New Productivity Paradigm

The amount of code that I can produce with AI assistance is mind-blowing, and I've already realised that I've become the bottleneck in my own workflow. While a deep understanding of coding remains crucial for effectively leveraging AI, these tools can generate more code than what my brain can process in each chunk of time.

I need rest ðŸ˜†.

This raises a question: am I limiting AI potential by constraining it to what I can comprehend and validate?

## The Hardware Race

The race for computational power now makes more sense even from a developer's perspective. AI tools that may also run or be enhanced locally on our machines demand increasingly more resources, and our effectiveness as developers depends increasingly on something that until now wasn't too important as individual: the computational power at our disposal.

## The Democratisation Paradox

Traditionally, business advantages stem from having some unique edge over competitors. But what happens in an AI-augmented world where everyone potentially becomes a "10x developer"? On the surface, we feel that we are moving faster but, relative to others with the same tools, we are mainly evening out.

AI appears democratising, almost everyone can greately increase their productivity, and it has been sold as such - everyone can access these powerful tools.

However, reality looks more complex:

1. Access to Premium Tools
   - The best AI tools typically require payment
   - Only when tools become obsolete do they become freely available

2. Computational Requirements
   - Better results often require more computational power
   - Access to superior hardware creates performance gaps

## The Widening Gap

The world has always operated on resource disparities, but AI's relentless productivity is amplifying these differences. The exponential difference between rich and poor people seems to be reaching the point where the curve starts being very steep.

## Looking Ahead

Intelligence has traditionally been measured on a relative scale - how we compare to others rather than against an absolute benchmark. In an AI-world, what happens if I become a 10x but everyone else is also a 10x?

The answer might not be as democratic as we'd hope. Access to resources - specifically money for computational power and early access to cutting-edge tools - appears to be a crucial factor in maintaining a competitive edge.
