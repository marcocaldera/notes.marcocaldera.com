# Expected Value: Making Better Decisions Under Uncertainty

{/* excerpt-start */}
We make decisions under uncertainty every day. Maybe because I am an engineer but I often find myself contemplating how to make the most rational choice in various situations. Many of these decisions are based on my understanding of probability and risk.

Should I buy insurance? Should I accept this job offer? When answering these questions, we typically consider both the probability of adverse events and their potential impact. Even if something is unlikely to happen, we might still want protection if its occurrence would significantly impact our lives.

What I recently realised is that I was intuitively applying the concept of "expected value." Putting a label to this mental process has helped me dive deeper into the concept and make better decisions. This article is my attempt to explain expected value clearly and concisely to my future self, hoping to preserve these insights for later reference.

## What is Expected Value?

Expected value helps evaluate choices by considering both the probability of different outcomes and their associated value.

It's calculated by multiplying each possible outcome (v) by its probability (p) and summing these products:
```
E = p₁ × v₁ + p₂ × v₂ + ... + pₙ × vₙ

where:
pᵢ = probability of outcome i (all probabilities sum to 1)
vᵢ = value of outcome i
```

## A Simple Example

Let's say you're offered a game where:
- You have a 70% chance of winning 100€
- You have a 30% chance of losing 50€

The expected value would be:
```
(0.70 × 100€) + (0.30 × -50€) = 70€ - 15€ = 55€
```

Since the expected value is positive (55€), you would expect to gain money on average if you played this game multiple times. This simple example shows how expected value can guide decision-making, but real-world scenarios are often more complex.

## Real World Applications

### Investment Decisions
Consider investing 10.000€ in a startup:
- 90% chance of failure (-10.000€) - most startups fail within the first few years<sup>1</sup>
- 9% chance of moderate success (5x return: +40.000€) - acquired or stable growth
- 1% chance of high success (20x return: +190.000€) - major exit

Expected value calculation:
```
(0,90 × -10.000€) + (0,09 × 40.000€) + (0,01 × 190.000€)
= -9.000€ + 3.600€ + 1.900€
= -3.500€
```
The negative expected value (-3.500€) reflects the harsh reality of startup investments: most fail, and even accounting for the rare huge successes, the pure mathematical expectation is negative. This explains why:
1. Professional investors diversify across many startups to increase their chances of hitting a "unicorn"
2. Other factors beyond pure financial return (like learning experience, network building, or passion for the project) often drive startup investments

### Insurance Choices
Consider home insurance costing 400€ per year:
- 98% chance of no claim (-400€)
- 1,9% chance of minor damage (save: 5.000€)
- 0,1% chance of major damage (save: 200.000€)

Expected value:
```
(0,98 × -400€) + (0,019 × 5.000€) + (0,001 × 200.000€)
= -392€ + 95€ + 200€
= -97€
```

The negative expected value reveals why insurance companies must charge more than the mathematically "fair" price. Yet we often buy insurance because we're "risk-averse" - preferring a certain small loss over a small chance of catastrophic loss.

### Career Decisions
Imagine choosing between:

Job A (Established Company):
- Base salary: 60.000€ (certain)
- Annual bonus: 5.000€ (80% probability)
Expected value: 60.000€ + (0,80 × 5.000€) = 64.000€

Job B (Startup):
- Base salary: 50.000€ (certain)
- Stock options: 0€ (70%), 100.000€ (25%), 500.000€ (5%)
Expected value: 50.000€ + (0,70 × 0€) + (0,25 × 100.000€) + (0,05 × 500.000€) = 75.000€

While Job B has a higher expected value, this highlights a key limitation: mathematical expectation doesn't capture practical constraints like:
- Income stability needs
- Monthly obligations (mortgage, family expenses)
- Personal risk tolerance

### The Lottery Example

A typical lottery has these characteristics:
- Ticket cost: 2,50€
- Jackpot: 17.000.000€
- Odds of winning jackpot: 1 in 139.838.160 (like finding a specific grain of sand on a beach)
- Smaller prizes probability: 7% (about 7 tickets out of 100 win something)
- Average smaller prize: 15€

Expected value calculation:
```
(0,000000007 × 17.000.000€) + (0,07 × 15€) - 2,50€
= 0,119€ + 1,05€ - 2,50€
= -1,32€ per ticket
```

This negative expectation explains why the lottery is called a "tax on hope" - people play for the dream rather than mathematical gain.

## Beyond Pure Mathematics

Through these examples, several important insights emerge:

1. Human psychology doesn't always align with mathematical optimisation
2. Personal risk tolerance affects decision-making
3. Some outcomes have value beyond numbers (emotional, strategic)

## Making Better Decisions

When using expected value:

1. List all possible outcomes
2. Estimate probabilities honestly
3. Calculate the mathematical expectation
4. Consider your personal risk tolerance
5. Factor in non-monetary aspects

## Conclusion
Expected value is a guide, not a guarantee. It helps us think systematically about uncertainty while acknowledging that real-world decisions often require considering factors beyond pure mathematics.
